Animal husbandry is the branch of agriculture concerned with animals that are raised for meat, fibre, milk, or other products. It includes day-to-day care, selective breeding, and the raising of livestock. Animal husbandry refers to livestock raising and selective breeding. It is the management and care of animals in which the genetic qualities and behavior of animals are further developed for profit. A large number of farmers depend upon animal husbandry for their livelihood.
Animals provide us with a variety of food products which have high nutritional values. Therefore, they require a lot of care and attention. Animals are bred commercially in order to meet the high demand for food. Dairy products from animals like cows, buffaloes, goats, are rich sources of protein. These animals are called milch animals as they provide us with milk. Another set of animals that provide nutrient-rich food are hen, ducks, goose, etc. They provide us with eggs, which again are rich sources of protein. Animals like chicken, duck, ox, goat, pigs, etc. are bred for meat. Other than these domestic animals we have other sources of nutrients as well, they are marine animals. The seafood we eat has very high nutrient values. They are sources of a variety of nutrients like fat, proteins, vitamins and minerals.
 The animals are bred, cared, reared and sheltered in a farm or region, which are specially built for them. Animal husbandry involves poultry, milk-farms, apiculture (bee agriculture), aquaculture, etc.

Animal husbandry has the following advantages:Animal husbandry helps in the proper management of animals by providing proper food, shelter and protection against diseases to domestic animals. It provides employment to a large number of farmer and thereby increases their living standards. It helps in developing high yielding breeds of animals by cross breeding. This increases the production of various food products such as milk, eggs, meat, and others. It involves the proper disposal of animal waste and promotes a healthy environment.

There are four major types of animal husbandry practiced in the world today they include Dairy Farming, Poultry Farming, Fish Farming


Animal husbandry is beneficial to human beings in the following ways:
Dairy Products: Animals such as cows, goats, sheep, etc. are the major source of milk and milk products such as yoghurt, cheese, butter, etc.Meat: Animals such as cows, buffaloes, pigs, and goats are reared for their meat. Their meat is a rich source of dietary protein. Land Management: The livestock is sometimes grazed to control the growth of weeds on agricultural land. The dry shrubs in the areas that are prone to wildfire are eaten by goat and sheep, which reduces the risk of fire.
Fiber: Animals also produce fibers or textiles such as wool and leather. For eg, sheep are reared for wool whereas leather can be obtained from camel. Manure: The excreta, blood and bones of animals are used as manure. The manure is spread on the fields to increase the crop yields and crop production. It is also used as fuel for fires and as plaster for walls and floor. Labor: Animals are a source of non-human labor. They are used for ploughing fields, transporting goods and military functions. For ag., horses, yaks and donkeys are used for such purposes.

Apiculture
what is beekeeping:
apiculture or beekeeping is the care and management of honey bees for the production of honey and wax. Apiculture is the scientific method of rearing honeybees. Bees are one of the many insects in the world that can produce something that is beneficial to all of us. We obtain honey from these bees and as we all know, honey is an important food for human beings. Since ancient times, honey is used for treating several diseases, and it is an antioxidant, therefore beekeeping is an important activity. In a colony, there are 10,000 to 60,000 bees! But all of them do not collect nectar- there is a strict division of labour. The queen bee and female bees lay thousands of eggs. Larvae that hatch are fed royal jelly and the duration that they are fed will decide their role as a worker or queen. The drone bees are male and their job is only to help in fertilizing the eggs laid by the queen, and the worker bees do the actual work of collecting nectar.

The main advantages of beekeeping are: Provides honey, which is the most valuable nutritional food, Provides bee wax which is used in many industries, including cosmetics industries, polishing industries, pharmaceutical industries, etc. Bees Play an excellent role in pollination. Honey bees are the best pollinating agents which help in increasing the yield of several crops. According to the recent studies, the honey bee venom contains a mixture of proteins which can potentially be used as a prophylactic to destroy HIV that causes AIDS in humans.
